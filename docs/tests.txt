These are the tests that you can run:

- Test 1:
  - exchanging messages, connecting and disconnecting from the server
  - run pt1 to start up, then run t1
- Test 2:
  - writing on the client and server at the same time (with 2 text areas)
  - run pt2 to start up, then run t2
- Test 3:
  - test crashing the client and reconnecting to the server
  - run pt3 to start up, then run t3
- Test simultaneous editing:
  - writing on the client and server at the same time (same text area)
  - second hand-in
  - run pts to start up, then run ts
- Test for latency:
  - Measures the delay after a character is written and shown (not very reliable)
  - run ptl to start up, then tl
- Test for multiple clients:
  - multiple clients, exchanging messages
  - third hand-in
  - run ptmc to start up, then tmc
- Test for multiple simultaneous editings:
  - Simultaneous editing on 2, 3 and 4 nodes
  - run ptms to start up, then tms (or tms2, tms3 or tms4)
- Test for churn
  - Connecting, disconnecting clients and the server
